## Customization

You can configure the conventions and style of commit messages by creating a configuration file called **mitsco.config.json** in the root directory of your project.

### Style

Define the style of the commit messages. Use **%type%** for the commit type and **%message%** for your custom message.

```json
{
    "style": "%type% : %message%" // feat : create new component
}
```

### Types

The type convention defines the categories of commits to be used. By default, Mitsco uses the types provided by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

```json
{
    "types": [
        {
            "type": "chore",
            "description": "used for maintenance tasks, refactoring, dependency updates, etc."
        },
        {
            "type": "feat",
            "description": "used to add a new feature."
        },
        {
            "type": "fix",
            "description": "used to fix a bug or issue."
        },
        {
            "type": "refactor",
            "description": "used for code changes that do not fix bugs or add new features."
        },
        {
            "type": "style",
            "description": "used for changes that do not affect code functionality (e.g., code formatting or style changes)."
        },
        {
            "type": "docs",
            "description": "used for documentation changes."
        },
        {
            "type": "test",
            "description": "used to add or improve tests."
        }
    ]
}
```
